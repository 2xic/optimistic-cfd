Norswap wrote the following regarding this (https://github.com/2xic/optimistic-cfd/issues/1):


(some rewording of his original comment)
My suggestion here would be to implement an "exit queue": anybody can queue their $C to be sold, and in this case, the protocol will use this pool of $C to supply to new users instead of minting new $C. (Note we can't use the protocol treasury for the same purpose, since some $C was minted out of thin air â€” the total $C supply is only partially backed.)

This can still be a big problem if the queue grows too much or too fast. 

We could avoid minting $CFD, and just offering a discount on a $C-$CFD AMM purchase. This would have the stabilizing benefit that if the exit queue gets too full, demand for $CFD will be stimulated. It goes without saying that this all requires more thinking / modelling.

This means that $CFD will go down in value when the TVL decreases. However, $CFD holders benefit when the TVL increases: when the queue is empty, the protocol mints $C in exchanged for other stablecoins, and those go straight to the protocol's treasury. And the treasury essentially provides a floor on the $CFD price.



##Some design thoughts

- The design of the exit queue probably need some parameter changes, so we should code based on this

The core part
- User need to initialize the withdrawal
- THe position should be replaced by the protocol (?)
    - Or I guess it should only happen when the actual order has exited the queue.
- 

### Questions
@norswap one question regarding the "exit queue". 

You wrote that using a protocol token (CFD) and doing AMM against the chip token ($C) as a method to keep the $C as close to 1$ as possible.

I assume we cannot just mint the other token since that would distance us further from the peg. So I think you envision an AMM structure like Uniswap  ? (correct me if I'm wrong here)

Wouldn't we then need a way to re-balance the AMM pool ? Since an a "whale" could start buying up more $c tokens  than we have in the pool, and try to withdraw.

- I guess if we go full uniswap this is not the case.
- delay asking the question, do some more research first :=)
